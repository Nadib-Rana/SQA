### ðŸŸ¢ **Testing**  
- **Purpose:** Find defects or bugs in the software.  
- **Focus:** Identifying whatâ€™s wrong.  
- **Activities:** Executing code, checking outputs against expected results.  
- **Performed by:** Testers, QA engineers, or developers.  
- **Example:** Running a unit test to check if the login function works correctly.  
- **Output:** A report of failed test cases or discovered bugs.  

### ðŸŸ¢ **Debugging**  
- **Purpose:** Fix defects or bugs in the software.  
- **Focus:** Understanding and resolving the cause of the issue.  
- **Activities:** Tracing the code, using breakpoints, analyzing logs.  
- **Performed by:** Developers or programmers.  
- **Example:** Investigating a failed login test, finding a null pointer error, and correcting the logic.  
- **Output:** Fixed code that passes the test or works as expected.  

### ðŸ”‘ **Key Differences**  
| **Aspect**            | **Testing**                                        | **Debugging**                                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Objective**         | Find bugs or defects                                | Fix the bugs or defects                        |
| **When it happens**   | After or during development                         | After testing reveals an issue                |
| **Main action**       | Running test cases, checking results                | Analyzing and modifying the code              |
| **Tools used**        | Test frameworks (Jest, Selenium, JUnit)             | Debuggers (VS Code debugger, GDB, Chrome DevTools) |
| **Role involved**     | Testers, QA engineers                               | Developers, programmers                       |
| **Output**            | Bug reports, failed test logs                      | Fixed code, verified solution                 |

### âœ… **Example Scenario**  
Suppose youâ€™re working on your **PlantProtective** app:  
- **Testing:** You run a test to check if image uploads work. The test fails.  
- **Debugging:** You investigate and find the image path isnâ€™t handled correctly. You fix the bug and rerun the test!
