**Verification** and **Validation** are both essential in software development to ensure the product meets requirements and is free of defects â€” but they serve different purposes. 

### ðŸŸ¢ **Verification**  
- **Purpose:** Are we building the product right?  
- **Focus:** Process-oriented (checking if the system is built according to specifications).  
- **Activities:** Reviews, inspections, walkthroughs, static testing.  
- **Example:** Checking the code against the design documents to see if it matches the design requirements.  
- **Timing:** During development (before the final product).  
- **Output:** Ensures the product aligns with design specifications.  

### ðŸŸ¢ **Validation**  
- **Purpose:** Are we building the right product?  
- **Focus:** Product-oriented (checking if the system meets the user's needs).  
- **Activities:** Testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), dynamic testing.  
- **Example:** Running the application to see if it works as intended and meets customer requirements.  
- **Timing:** After development (with the finished product).  
- **Output:** Ensures the product fulfills the intended purpose and satisfies the user's expectations.  

### ðŸ”‘ **Key Differences**  
| **Aspect**            | **Verification**                               | **Validation**                                |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Objective**         | Ensure software meets specifications           | Ensure software meets user needs            |
| **Question Answered** | Are we building the product right?              | Are we building the right product?          |
| **Methods**           | Reviews, inspections, static analysis          | Testing, UAT, beta testing                   |
| **When Performed**    | Before coding is complete                      | After coding, during or after testing       |
| **Type of Testing**   | Static (without running the code)              | Dynamic (running and testing the code)      |
