**Testing goals** based on the maturity of your testing process! The more mature your testing process, the more advanced and strategic your goals become. 

This aligns well with models like **TMMi (Test Maturity Model Integration)** or **CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)**, which outline how testing evolves over time. I’ll walk you through it step by step!

---

### 📊 **Level 1: Initial (Ad-hoc Testing)**
- **Goal:** Find and fix critical bugs as quickly as possible.
- **Focus:** Basic defect detection.
- **Common Practices:** Unstructured, exploratory testing without formal processes.
- **Example Goal:** Ensure core functionality works before release, even without formal documentation.

---

### 📈 **Level 2: Managed (Repeatable)**
- **Goal:** Establish basic test planning and tracking.
- **Focus:** Systematic bug detection with planned test cases.
- **Common Practices:** Test planning, test design, and tracking test results.
- **Example Goal:** Achieve at least 80% test case coverage for core features of your app (like image upload or disease detection in **PlantProtective**).

---

### 🛠 **Level 3: Defined (Documented Process)**
- **Goal:** Integrate testing into the development lifecycle.
- **Focus:** Process standardization and early defect prevention.
- **Common Practices:** Unit tests, integration tests, requirement-based testing.
- **Example Goal:** Catch 90% of defects during unit and integration testing, reducing defects in production.

---

### 🚀 **Level 4: Measured (Quantified & Optimized)**
- **Goal:** Use metrics to improve software quality.
- **Focus:** Defect prediction and test effectiveness analysis.
- **Common Practices:** Defect density analysis, code coverage metrics.
- **Example Goal:** Use test coverage tools in **React** or **Django** to maintain 95% code coverage.

---

### 🏆 **Level 5: Optimized (Continuous Improvement)**
- **Goal:** Achieve continuous quality improvement.
- **Focus:** Test automation, AI-driven testing, and preventive strategies.
- **Common Practices:** Automated regression tests, self-healing tests, shift-left testing.
- **Example Goal:** Automate 100% of regression tests to catch issues early, minimizing manual testing effort.

### ✅ **How This Applies to Your Work**
Since you’re working on **PlantProtective** and using **React**, **Django**, and even training AI models, you could aim for **Level 4 or Level 5** by:
- Using **Jest** for unit testing React components.
- Implementing **PyTest** for Django backend testing.
- Automating image upload and disease detection tests.
- Tracking test coverage with tools like **Codecov** or **Coveralls**.
