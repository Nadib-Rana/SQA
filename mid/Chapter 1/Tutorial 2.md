# 🏷️ **What is Quality?**  

Quality is defined as a product or service that is **"fit for use and purpose."** It ensures that customer needs and expectations are met in terms of **functionality, design, reliability, durability, and price.**  

---

# 🛡️ **What is Assurance?**  

Assurance is a positive declaration about a product or service, ensuring it functions as expected without issues. It provides a **guarantee** that the product meets required standards and will perform reliably.

# 💻 **Software Quality**  

### **IEEE Definition:**  
1️⃣ The degree to which a system, component, or process meets specified requirements.  
2️⃣ The degree to which a system, component, or process meets customer or user needs and expectations.  

### **Pressman’s Definition:**  
Conformance to explicitly stated **functional and performance requirements**, documented development standards, and implicit characteristics expected of professionally developed software.

# 📊 **Quality Software**  

**Quality software** refers to software that:  
✅ Is reasonably bug-free  
✅ Is delivered on time and within budget  
✅ Meets requirements and user expectations  
✅ Is maintainable  

### **🔹 Functional Quality:**  
How well the software satisfies **functional requirements** or specifications.  

### **🔹 Structural Quality:**  
How well the software handles **non-functional requirements**, such as robustness, maintainability, and adherence to development standards.

# 🔍 **Software Quality Assurance (SQA) vs. Software Quality Control (SQC)**  

| **Aspect**                      | **Software Quality Assurance (SQA)**                                            | **Software Quality Control (SQC)**                                           |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**                        | **Process-focused**                                                             | **Product-focused**                                                          |
| **Objective**                    | Ensures quality in software engineering processes to improve development practices | Identifies and fixes defects in the final software product                   |
| **Activities**                   | Evaluation and improvement of processes used to produce software                 | Testing and inspecting the final product to find defects                     |
| **Goal**                         | Prevent defects by improving the process                                        | Detect and correct defects in the final product                               |
| **Stage**                        | Activities performed throughout the development process                         | Activities performed after the product is developed, before shipping         |
| **Real-life Example**            | A team adopts an agile development process, conducts regular code reviews, and uses continuous integration to catch issues early in the process. | A team tests the final version of a mobile app by running unit tests, integration tests, and performing user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure there are no bugs before release. |

**Real-Life Example for SQA:**  
In an agile development environment, developers might use automated testing frameworks like **JUnit** or **Selenium** to ensure their code is correct every time changes are made. This approach ensures that the process of writing code and testing it is robust and helps in catching errors early in the development lifecycle.

**Real-Life Example for SQC:**  
Before releasing a new mobile app, a **Quality Control team** would manually test the application on different devices to ensure there are no visual glitches, crashes, or functional issues. This could include exploratory testing, performance testing, and verifying that all user features work as expected.

# 🆚 **Quality Control vs. Quality Assurance**  

### ✅ **Quality Control (IEEE, 1991):**  
"A set of activities designed to evaluate the quality of a developed or manufactured product." These activities occur **after development** and **before the product is shipped** to ensure it meets the required standards.  

### ✅ **Quality Assurance:**  
Aims to **prevent** defects early in the development process, reducing the cost of fixing issues later. QA ensures that the **processes** used to develop the product lead to high-quality output.

# 🚧 **Software Quality Challenges**  

### 🔹 **1. Product Complexity:**  
🔸 Industrial products have only a few thousand operational modes.  
🔸 Software products have **millions of possible operations**, making it difficult to test all scenarios.  

### 🔹 **2. Product Visibility:**  
🔸 Industrial products are **visible**, making defects easier to detect.  
🔸 Software is **invisible** (stored digitally), so defects can remain hidden until testing or real-world use.

# 🔄 **Software vs. Other Products**  

| **Characteristic**             | **Software Products**                       | **Other Industrial Products**                  |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Complexity**                 | Millions of operational possibilities      | Thousands of operational possibilities       |
| **Visibility of Product**      | Invisible, defects are harder to detect    | Visible, defects can be easily spotted      |
| **Development Process**        | Defects can only be detected in the development phase | Defects can be identified in multiple stages: Development, Production Planning, Manufacturing |
