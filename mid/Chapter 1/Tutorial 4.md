1. **Faulty Requirements Definition**
2. **Client‚ÄìDeveloper Communication Failures**
3. **Deliberate Deviations from Software Requirements**
4. **Logical Design Errors**
5. **Coding Errors**
6. **Non-compliance with Documentation and Coding Instructions**
7. **Shortcomings of the Testing Process**
8. **Procedure Errors**
9. **Documentation Errors**

## üêû **The Term "Bug"**

The term **bug** is often used informally, sometimes meaning **fault**, **error**, or **failure**‚Äîbut it‚Äôs not always clear.

### **Fun Fact:**  
Thomas Edison on bugs in his inventions:
> ‚ÄúIt has been just so in all of my inventions. The first step is an intuition, and comes with a burst, then difficulties arise‚Äîthis thing gives out and **[bugs]** show themselves‚Ä¶‚Äù

Ada Lovelace also referred to bugs in her notes on the **Analytical Engine**:
> "An analyzing process must equally have been performed in order to furnish the Analytical Engine with the necessary operative data; and herein may also lie a possible source of error."

## üñ•Ô∏è **What is a Computer Bug?**

In **1947**, at Harvard University, a **Mark II computer** encountered a **bug** when a moth flew into it. The moth got zapped by high voltage, causing a malfunction.

> **And thus, the first computer bug was discovered!**

- **Defect**
- **Fault**
- **Problem**
- **Error**
- **Incident**
- **Anomaly**
- **Variance**
- **Failure**
- **Inconsistency**
- **Product Anomaly**
- **Product Incident**
- **Feature** (sometimes üòâ)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Defective Software**

It's nearly impossible to create completely **defect-free** software. The software we build (including yours!) will likely **contain defects**, and predicting their exact number and type is challenging. However, **perfection** is often out of reach.

## üö® **Sources of Problems in Software Development**

1. **Requirements Definition**  
   - Erroneous, incomplete, or inconsistent requirements can lead to major issues right from the start.

2. **Design**  
   - Fundamental design flaws in the software can create a shaky foundation for the entire system.

3. **Implementation**  
   - Mistakes in chip fabrication, wiring, programming faults, and even malicious code can cause significant problems.

4. **Support Systems**  
   - Poor programming languages, faulty compilers and debuggers, and misleading development tools can contribute to defects.

5. **Inadequate Testing of Software**  
   - Incomplete testing, poor verification, and mistakes during debugging may leave hidden flaws in the software.

6. **Evolution**  
   - Sloppy redevelopment or maintenance can introduce new flaws while attempting to fix old ones, leading to escalating complexity over time.
