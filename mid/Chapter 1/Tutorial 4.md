## 🐞 **The Term "Bug"**

The term **bug** is often used informally, sometimes meaning **fault**, **error**, or **failure**—but it’s not always clear.

### **Fun Fact:**  
Thomas Edison on bugs in his inventions:
> “It has been just so in all of my inventions. The first step is an intuition, and comes with a burst, then difficulties arise—this thing gives out and **[bugs]** show themselves…”

Ada Lovelace also referred to bugs in her notes on the **Analytical Engine**:
> "An analyzing process must equally have been performed in order to furnish the Analytical Engine with the necessary operative data; and herein may also lie a possible source of error."

## 🖥️ **What is a Computer Bug?**

In **1947**, at Harvard University, a **Mark II computer** encountered a **bug** when a moth flew into it. The moth got zapped by high voltage, causing a malfunction.

> **And thus, the first computer bug was discovered!**

## ⚠️ **Defective Software**

It's nearly impossible to create completely **defect-free** software. The software we build (including yours!) will likely **contain defects**, and predicting their exact number and type is challenging. However, **perfection** is often out of reach.
